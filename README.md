# IRC-Discord-CE-Bridge
A chat relay between IRC, Discord &amp; Counter Earth parcels and channels

This is a fork of the projects at 
  https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc
  and
  https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/User:Robin_Cornelius/IRC_LSL_Bridge

The LSL code has been heavily refactored by riah for reliability.

This project was created as a means to enable all three platforms to communicate together.

On the perl side I would highly recommend setting a heatbeat cron to make sure it is still running. There may be issues where certain relayed characters will kill it. This will be addressed in future versions.
